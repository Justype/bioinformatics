## R Session

- Default Workspace
  - Workspace contains the different R objects and function only (not the commands)
  - The name of the default workspace is saved as .RData
  - To load .RData, set the directory where .RData is located as current directory and then select to “load Default workspace”
- Working Directory
  - It is a good idea to have separate workspace and history for different projects saved in different directories (folders)
