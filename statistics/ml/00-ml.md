# Machine Learning

    [Machine Learning is the] field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
    —Arthur Samuel, 1959

    A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
    —Tom Mitchell, 1997

## Terminology

- *training set*
- *training instance* (*example*)
- *training data*
- *data mining* : discover pattern from a large amount of data

[hands on ML Page 33](hands-on-machine-learning.pdf#page=33)

1. automatic evolve without intervention
2. solution require a lot of hand-tuning
3. too complex problems (for traditional approaches)
4. problems with no known algorithm
5. get insights about complex problems and big data

## Types

- under human supervision: *supervised*, *unsupervised*, *semisupervised*, *reinforcement learning*
- learn incrementally on the fly: *online*, *batch*
- comparing new data to known OR detect patterns and build model *instance-based*, *model-based*

### Supervised

most common types: 

1. *classification*: add class to each email (spam or ham)
2. *regression*: predict a *target* numeric value with a set of *features* called *predictors*: predict the price of a car with mileage, age, brand

most important supervised learning algorithms:

- k-Nearest Neighbors
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
- Decision Tree and Random Forests
- Neural networks

### Unsupervised

most important unsupervised learning algorithms:

- Clustering
  - K-Means
  - DBSCAN
  - Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)
- Anomaly detection and novelty detection
  - One-class SVM
  - Isolation Forest
- Visualization and dimensionality reduction
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - Kernel PCA
  - Locally-Linear Embedding (LLE)
  - t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
- Association rule learning
  - Apriori
