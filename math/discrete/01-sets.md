# Set 集合

A **set** is a collection of objects.

By a set we mean any collection M into a whole of **definite distinct** objects m (which we called elements of M) of our perception or of our thought. (Cantor's way)

Examples:

- A = Students in a class
- B = {1, 3, 4, 7}
- Z = Integers

## Symbols

- $\in$ means in
- $\notin$ means not in

Examples

- $a \in B$ : element a is in the set B.
- $John \in A$ : John is in A.
- $\pi \notin Z$ $\pi$ is not a element of Integers

## Properties

- Order and Repetition do not matter
  - {1,3,4,7} = {4,3,1,7} = {7,4,3,1,3,7}

## Set Notation 集合表示方法

1. Set-Roster Notation
  - positive even integers: {0,2,4,6,...}
  - even integers: {...,-4,-2,0,2,4,...}
2. Set-Builder Notation
  - $\{x|P(x)\}$ complicated sets

# Subset 子集

Every element of A is also in B. => A is a subset of B. $A \subseteq B$

## Symbols

- $\subseteq$ subset
- $\nsubseteq$ not subset

Examples:

- $\{1,2\} \subseteq \{1,2,5,7\}$
