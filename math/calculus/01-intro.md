# Calculus 微积分

Mathematical study of continuous change

Two branches

- Differential calculus 微分
  - study rates of change
- Integral calculus 积分
  - study of areas under curves

## Differential Calculus

calculate the slope ($M$)

- first derivative 一阶导数
  - speed = distance / time
- second derivative 二阶导数
  - acceleration = speed / time = distance / (time * time)

## Method of Exhaustion

Infinitesimals

As integral accuracy improves as we approach an infinite-sided polygon, so too does differential accuracy improve as we approach a curve infinitely closely:
