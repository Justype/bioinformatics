# Experimental Design

## Data Sequencing

[P27](molecular-population-genetics.pdf#page=27)

full sequence data from each sampled chromosome. 

## population sampling

- most of time: **10-50** chromosomes (so 5-25 diploid individuals)
  - If NOT caring about allele frequency, longer region is more powerful than the larger samples.
- **unrelated** individuals
- subpopulation: Ch.5
