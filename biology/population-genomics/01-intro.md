# Intro to Population Genetics

Molecular population genetics is the study of **mutations** as they **rise and fall in frequency** in a population.

mainly focus on the *effects of evolutionary process* on natural populations

1. genetic drift
2. recombination
3. natural selection

Evolutionary forces can 

- **accelerate** or **impede** mutation.
- be inferred from pattern of molecular variation.
- includes: mutation, recombination, natural selection

## Terminology

[Books P21](molecular-population-genetics.pdf#page=21)

- *sequence* or *chromosome* : homologous DNA stand
- *genes* : sequences at a single locus 
- *allele*: individual nucleotides (or amino acids) at a single position in the alignment
- *sample*
- *cistron* 顺反子
- *allele copy*
- *polymorphism* = *segregating site* = *mutation* = *SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism)*
- *haplotype*: set of alleles found on a single sequence (see example below)
- *mutation*: process of generating variation
- *substitution* DNA differences **between** species
- *variation* DNA differences **in** species

Example:

```
     |1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
seq1 |T T A C A A T C C G  A  T  C  G  T
seq2 |T T A C G A T G C G  C  T  C  G  T
seq3 |T C A C A A T G C G  A  T  G  G  A
seq4 |T T A C G A T G C G  C  T  C  G  T
```

- sample size n = 4 chromosome
- length L = 15
- six sites with nucleotide differences (2,5,8,11,13,15) S = 6
- There are 3 haplotypes. seq2 and seq4 are the same.
